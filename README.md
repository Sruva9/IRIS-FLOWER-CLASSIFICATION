# Iris-Flower-Classification
Summary of the Solution:

The task involves training a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their measurements. The measurements include features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. We have been given information that the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, which can be used for this task.

The provided code outlines a solution for classifying iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning techniques. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Importing necessary libraries**: The code imports essential libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, machine learning, and data visualization.

2. **Loading the dataset**: The Iris dataset is loaded from a CSV file.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including removing the 'Id' column as it's not relevant to the analysis. Then, the dataset is split into features (X) and labels (y).

4. **Model Creation and Training**:
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model**: A KNN classifier with one neighbor is created and trained on the training data.
   - **Decision Tree Model**: A Decision Tree classifier is created and trained on the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The accuracy of both KNN and Decision Tree models is evaluated on both the training and test datasets. This step assesses how well the models can classify the iris flowers.

6. **New Predictions**: The trained models are used to make predictions on new input samples with iris measurements.

7. **Data Visualization**: Data visualization is performed using a pairplot to visualize the relationships between features. Additionally, a bar chart compares the training and test accuracies of the models, providing insights into their performance.

8. **Conclusion**: The code comments summarize the results, stating that both KNN and Decision Tree models were trained and evaluated. It highlights the achieved accuracy and successful predictions for new input samples. Furthermore, the importance of data visualization in assessing model performance is emphasized.

In summary, the solution offers a comprehensive approach to classifying iris species using machine learning techniques. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, providing valuable insights into model performance and dataset characteristics.
